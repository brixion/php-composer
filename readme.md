## PHP-Composer
Feel free to use our docker images located at [brixion/php-composer](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/brixion/php-composer).

> This takes the latest stable official PHP Docker images (currently
> `php: 8.1-cli`, `php:8.0-cli`, `php:7.4-cli`), and adds in Git,
> Composer, Zip, as well as common PHP modules.

The `:latest` tag uses php:8.0-cli but the `:7.4` tag  and `:8.1` are also available for usage.

Feel free to leave any suggestions or implementations in the discussions tab, I would love to hear if this image has helped you out :).
